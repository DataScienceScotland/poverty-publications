This publication presents estimates of the proportion of people, children, working-age adults and pensioners living in persistent poverty in Scotland and in the other countries in the UK. The estimates are used to monitor progress in reducing poverty.

The latest persistent poverty estimates relate to the period between January 2017 and December 2021. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a small impact on data collection, see the [Data source section](#corona-impact) for more information.

## Key points

- Between `r params$data_period_long`, `r persistenttables$tableScotland$pp %>% tail(1L)` of people in Scotland were in persistent poverty after housing costs. 

- Persistent poverty rates were highest for children (`r persistenttables$tableScotland$ch %>% tail(1L)`), and lower for working-age adults (`r persistenttables$tableScotland$wa %>% tail(1L)`) and pensioners (`r persistenttables$tableScotland$pn %>% tail(1L)`). 

- Not everyone in poverty is in persistent poverty: More than a third of people in poverty move out of poverty each year. At the same time, a similar number of people who were not in poverty previously newly enter poverty each year.

## What you need to know

Poverty can be measured in a number of different ways, each of which can tell us something different about poverty. One of the most common measures is relative (income) poverty which identifies people living in households with an equivalised income below 60% of the UK median household income. It therefore measures whether those in the lowest income households are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole. Statistics on relative poverty in Scotland can be found in the [Poverty and Income Inequality in Scotland](.) report.

The statistics in this report provide information on persistent poverty in Scotland. **Persistent poverty identifies individuals who live in relative poverty for three or more of the last four years.** It therefore identifies people who have been living in poverty for a significant period of time, which is more damaging than brief periods spent with a low income. The impacts can affect an individual throughout their lifetime.

The estimates in this publication are derived from the Understanding Society survey. Understanding Society is a `r abbr("UK", "United Kingdom")`-wide longitudinal survey that captures information about peopleâ€™s social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health. Being longitudinal, the same individuals are interviewed each year allowing identification of those who have been in poverty over a number of years.

Some estimates from previous years have been improved and will therefore differ between publications. The latest publication provides the most accurate estimates. [More information about revisions](#revisions) is available.

This publication presents persistent poverty estimates for eight overlapping periods from 2010-2014 to `r params$data_period`. It also includes poverty entry and exit rates.
