**A Scottish Government National Statistics publication**

Published on `r params$pub_day`

This publication presents three-year averaged estimates of the percentage of people, children, working-age adults and pensioners in Scotland living in poverty, and other statistics on household income and income inequality. These estimates are used to monitor progress in reducing poverty, child poverty and income inequality.

The latest estimates relate to the period between April 2017 and March 2020, before the first `r abbr("UK", "United Kingdom")`-wide lockdown due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, these statistics do not yet tell us anything about the impact of the pandemic on poverty and income inequality.

## Key trends

* Relative poverty had been falling slightly between the nineties and the lowest point in this time series in 2009-12. It then started to rise again but appears now stable.
* Income inequality continues to fluctuate.
* Median household incomes continue to rise.

Longer-term trends of poverty and income inequality in the `r abbr("UK", "United Kingdom")`, which are similar to those in Scotland, are available from the Department for Work and Pensions' [Households Below Average Income publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201819) on page 12 of the main report.
