This publication presents three-year averaged estimates of the percentage of people, children, working-age adults and pensioners in Scotland living in poverty, and other statistics on household income and income inequality. These estimates are used to monitor progress in reducing poverty, child poverty and income inequality.

## Key trends

* Poverty may have stopped rising, although further years are required to confirm this.
* Income inequality continues to fluctuate.
* Median household incomes continue to rise.
