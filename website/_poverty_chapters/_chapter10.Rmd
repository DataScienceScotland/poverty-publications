## Associated tables and further analysis

This publication contains the headline poverty and household income statistics. The associated tables contain all data used in the charts as well as additional data, for example, the equivalent before-housing-costs estimates where charts show after-housing-costs estimates only. The associated tables are [available for download](download.html).

Additional relative and severe poverty and child poverty estimates including numbers, rates and compositions of those in poverty disaggregated by a wide range of personal and household characteristics are also available.

Additional analysis themes are based on the needs of users. If you have any suggestions for future analysis please [contact us](index.html#contact).
