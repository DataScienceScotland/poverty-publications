The data used to produce the charts of the main report and the Child Poverty update is available for download below. The files also contain further poverty and child poverty analysis which is not shown in the charts of the main report.

## Poverty and child poverty data

Estimates are averages of three years' worth of data in order to reduce data volatility and show trends more accurately:

- [**all data (xlsx, 330 KB)**](xls/All three-year average.xlsx) - all data from the main report, plus additional poverty and child poverty breakdowns
- [confidence intervals (docx, 26 KB)](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2020/03/poverty-income-inequality-scotland-2016-19/documents/confidence-intervals/confidence-intervals/govscot%3Adocument/confidence-intervals.docx) - measurement uncertainty information for the headline estimates

In addition, the estimates of the headline indicators based on single years of data are also available. These are used in the [Child poverty summary](cpupdate.html) alongside the trend data, but otherwise not used in the charts:

- [single-year poverty and income data (xlsx, 71 KB)](xls/All single year.xlsx)

## Persistent poverty data

Tables of the persistent poverty estimates are included in the [Persistent Poverty report](persistent.html).
