The Child Poverty Act 2017 contains four income-based targets to reduce child poverty in Scotland by 2030. The charts show the interim and final targets and the latest poverty estimates. Note that the dots and labels show single-year estimates and the lines show the three-year averages. Single-year estimates can be used to understand the situation at a certain point in time, and three-year averages show trends more accurately.
