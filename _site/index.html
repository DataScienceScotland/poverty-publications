<p>This publication presents three-year averaged estimates of the percentage of people, children, working-age adults and pensioners in Scotland living in poverty, and other statistics on household income and income inequality. These estimates are used to monitor progress in reducing poverty, child poverty and income inequality.</p>

<div id="what-you-need-to-know" class="section level1">
<h1>What you need to know</h1>
<p>Statistics in this report are based on data from the Family Resources Survey. This survey has been the main source of information on household income and poverty in Scotland since 1994/95.</p>
<div id="income-and-poverty-measures" class="section level3">
<h3>Income and poverty measures</h3>
<p>The Scottish Government uses a range of indicators to measure different aspects of poverty. The most commonly used poverty indicator in Scotland is relative poverty after housing costs. It is complemented in this publication by measures of absolute poverty and material deprivation.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, these statistics are based on net income (adjusted for household size). Net income is income after taxes and includes social security payments. All incomes are in 2018/19 prices (real prices). Figures in this publication are rounded to the nearest pound (weekly incomes), a hundred pound (annual incomes), percentage point or 10,000 people. Poverty is measured at the household level. If the household income is below the poverty threshold, all people within the household are considered to be in poverty.</p>
</div>
<div id="survey-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey data</h3>
<p>The estimates presented in this publication are based on a sample survey and are therefore subject to sampling error. None of the latest changes in the estimated numbers and percentages of people presented in the body of this report are statistically significant. In time series, looking at longer term trends offers a better indication of significant change.</p>
</div>
<div id="three-year-averages" class="section level3">
<h3>Three-year averages</h3>
<p>Data is presented as three-year rolling (overlapping) averages of each estimate. For example, the latest estimates (2016-19) are an average of the single-year estimates in the financial years 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19, and the previous estimates are an average of the single-year estimates in the financial years 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18.</p>
<p>Using three-year averages ensures the statistics are usable and understandable, and that they are comparable with poverty and income statistics reported by the Department for Work and Pensions. Three-year averages are best used when focusing on trends over time, as in this publication. Single-year estimates are also available in the associated tables.</p>

<h5>Figure 1 - Proportion of people in relative poverty, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="01_relpovpp.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>It is estimated that 19% of Scotland’s population (1.02 million people each year) were living in relative poverty after housing costs in 2016-19. Before housing costs, 17% of the population (900,000 people) were living in poverty in 2016-19.</p>
<p>Relative poverty is a measure of whether the income of the poorest households are keeping pace with middle income households across the UK.</p>
<p>The proportion of people in relative poverty after housing costs had been falling slightly between the late nineties and the lowest point in this time series in 2009-12. After that, it started to rise again up until now, where the rise appears to have stopped. Before housing costs poverty looks similar, with the all-time low slightly later, in 2011-14.</p>
</div>

<div id="absolute-poverty-rate-for-all-individuals-stable" class="section level4">
<h4>Absolute poverty rate for all individuals stable</h4>

<h5>Figure 2 - Proportion of people in absolute poverty, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="02_abspovpp.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>It is estimated that 17% of Scotland’s population (910,000 people each year) were living in absolute poverty after housing costs in 2016-19. After a long decline since the beginning of this time series in the mid-nineties, absolute poverty rates have stagnated since 2006-09.</p>
<p>Before housing costs, 14% of Scotland’s population (770,000 people each year) were in absolute poverty. The trend is similar to the after housing costs measure, although the downward trend started to stagnate a few years later.</p>
<p>The gap between the before and after housing costs measure had widened in 2008-11, but has remained steady since.</p>
<p>Absolute poverty is a measure of whether the incomes of the poorest households are keeping pace with inflation, and is based on a fixed poverty threshold, the relative poverty threshold in 2010/11.</p>

<h5>Figure 3 - Proportion of children in relative poverty, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="03_relpovch.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>It is estimated that 24% of children (230,000 children each year) were living in relative poverty after housing costs in 2016-19. Before housing costs, it is estimated that 20% of children (200,000 children each year) were in relative poverty.</p>
<p>After a long fall between 1999-02 and 2010-13, which halted briefly just before the recession, child poverty rates had been rising again but did not rise in the latest periods.</p>
<p>The Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017 requires us to report annually on a number of child poverty measures. The latest single-year estimates can be found in the Child Poverty Update section below.</p>
</div>

<h5>Figure 4 - Proportion of children in absolute poverty, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="04_abspovch.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>Absolute child poverty after housing costs affected 21% (210,000 children each year). Before housing costs, absolute child poverty was at 17% (160,000 children each year).</p>
<p>Absolute child poverty before housing costs steadily decreased between the mid-nineties and just before the recession. The decrease of the after housing costs rate then slowed down. The before housing costs measure continued to decrease until 2013-16 and has been largely flat since. As a result, the gap between absolute child poverty before and after housing costs widened in recent years.</p>
<p>In this publication, ‘child’ refers to a dependent child. This is explained in Annex B. Definitions.</p>

<h5>Figure 5 - Proportion of children in combined low income and material deprivation, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="05_matdepch.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>It is estimated that 12% of children (120,000 children each year) were living in combined low income and material deprivation after housing costs in 2016-19. Before housing costs, this was 11% of children (110,000 children).</p>
<p>Combined low income and child material deprivation is an additional way of measuring living standards and refers to the inability of households to afford basic goods and activities that are seen as necessities in society.</p>
<p>More detail on this can be found in the Annex B. Definitions.</p>
<p>Material deprivation data has been collected since 2004/05. Due to a change in the methodology, it is not possible to compare the most recent years with years before 2010-13. The break in the time series indicates this change.</p>

<div id="figure-6---proportion-of-children-in-relative-poverty-who-live-in-working-households-scotland" class="section level5">
<h5>Figure 6 - Proportion of children in relative poverty who live in working households, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="06_workpovch.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>While the poverty risk is much lower for children in working households compared to those in non-working households, not all work pays enough to lift the household above the poverty threshold.</p>
<p>It is estimated that in 2016-19, 65% of children in relative poverty after housing costs (150,000 children each year) were living in working households. Before housing costs, 64% of children in poverty (130,000 children) were living in working households.</p>
<p>This data suggests that after a steady and steep increase of in-work poverty since 2007-10, in-work poverty is now stable at a high level.</p>
<p>The terms ‘working’ and ‘in-work poverty’ here refer to paid employment only. In-work poverty refers to people living in households where at least one member of the household is in either full or part-time paid work, but where the household income is below the relative poverty threshold.</p>

<h5>Figure 7 - Proportion of working-age adults in relative poverty, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="07_relpovwa.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>Relative poverty for working-age adults has been broadly stable since reporting began. Relative poverty in 2016-19 was estimated to be 19% after housing costs, and 16% before housing costs.</p>
<p>In 2016-19, there were 640,000 working-age adults in poverty after housing costs, compared to 530,000 before housing costs.</p>
<p>Working-age adults are defined as all adults up to the state pension age. State pension age is currently 65 for men, and since November 2018 also for women.</p>

<p>Absolute poverty amongst working-age adults remained broadly stable during the last fifteen years. In 2016-19, 17% of working-age adults were in absolute poverty after housing costs, and 14% before housing costs.</p>
<p>This means that in 2016-19, there were 580,000 working-age adults each year in absolute poverty after housing costs, compared to 460,000 before housing costs.</p>
<p>Working-age adults are considered to be in poverty when they live in a household which is in poverty.</p>

<p>In 2016-19, 60% of working-age adults in relative poverty after housing costs as well as before housing costs were living in working households. This represents 380,000 working-age adults in poverty after housing costs, and 310,000 working-age adults before housing costs.</p>
<p>In-work poverty for working-age adults continuously increased since 2011-14, and in the most recent period, it continued to be at its highest since reporting began.</p>
<p>The terms ‘working’ and ‘in-work poverty’ here refer to paid employment only. In-work poverty refers to people living in households where at least one member of the household is in either full or part-time paid work, but where the household income is below the relative poverty threshold.</p>

<p>Income is measured at a household level, which makes it difficult to measure the poverty rate for individual adults living with a partner. For those women and men who live in households with other adults, all adults will either be above or below the poverty threshold. In the analysis below, we therefore only include single adult households (with or without dependent children).</p>

<p>Some of the difference in pensioner poverty between genders may be due to different age profiles.

<p>Poverty rates remain higher for households in which somebody is disabled compared to those where no-one is disabled. The gap between the two groups has remained fairly steady over the last few years.</p>
<p>In 2016-19, the poverty rate after housing costs for people in households with a disabled person was 23% (490,000 people each year). This compares with 17% (530,000 people) in a household without disabled household members.</p>

<p>The way in which information on disabled people is collected changed several times during this timeseries.

Since 2012/13, disabled people are identified as those who report any physical or mental health condition(s) or illness(es) that last or are expected to last 12 months or more, and which limit their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. Due to these changes, care needs to be taken when considering long-term trends.</p>

<h3>Additional living costs of disabled people</h3>
<p>The relative poverty measure doesn’t take into account the fact that additional living costs may be incurred due to the illness or disability in question. The analysis on the following page attempts to make an adjustment to the poverty rates to partly account for additional living costs for those households where someone is in receipt of disability benefits.</p>

<h5>Figure 19 - Proportion of people in relative poverty (disability benefits removed from household income) after housing costs, Scotland</h5>
<p><img src="19_disability2.png" width="708" /></p>
<p>Whilst it is recognised that there are additional costs associated with disability, research shows that these vary greatly in level and nature, and there is no general agreement on how to measure these costs.</p>
<p>Analysis on this page excludes Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payments from total household income. These benefits are paid as a contribution towards the additional living costs for disabled people. If this income is excluded from total household income, then we are able to compare households with and without a disabled household member on a more like for like basis.</p>
<p>In 2016-19, as in previous years, the poverty rate was higher for individuals in households with a disabled person, when disability related benefits are not included in the household income. After housing costs, the poverty rate was 29% (620,000 people each year) for people living with a disabled household member, and 16% (500,000 people) for those without.</p>
<p>Before housing costs data is available in the associated tables.</p>
<p>Excluding disability benefits from the analysis changes the poverty threshold. This is because some households now move down the income distribution, which lowers the median income and therefore also the poverty threshold. As a consequence, some households without a disabled person that were just below the poverty threshold in the previous analysis will now be above the threshold. As a result, the poverty rate for households without a disabled person is slightly lower.</p>

This measure of how equally income is distributed across the population is known as the “Palma ratio” or “S90/S40 ratio”.

<h3>Family Resources Survey, Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset</h3>
<p>All the figures in this publication come from the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) Households Below Average Income dataset which is produced from the Family Resources Survey. UK figures are published by DWP in ‘Households Below Average Income: 2018/19’ on the same day as ‘Poverty and Income Inequality in Scotland: 2016-19’.

<div id="what-does-hbai-measure" class="section level3">
<h3>What does HBAI measure?</h3>
<p>Households Below Average Income (HBAI) uses household disposable incomes, adjusted for the household size and composition, as a proxy for material living standards. More precisely, it is a proxy for the level of consumption of goods and services that people could attain given the disposable income of the household in which they live.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis is the individual, so the populations and percentages in the tables are numbers and percentages of individuals - both adults and children.</p>
<p>The living standards of an individual depend not only on his or her own income, but also on the income of others in the household. Consequently, the analyses are based on total household income: the equivalised income of a household is taken to represent the income level of every individual in the household. Equivalisation, a technique that allows comparison of incomes between households of different sizes and compositions, is explained in Annex B under Equivalisation. Thus, all members of any one household will appear at the same point in the income distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-costs" class="section level3">
<h3>Housing Costs</h3>
<p>It could be argued that the costs of housing faced by different households at a given time do not always match the true value of the housing that they actually enjoy, and that housing costs should therefore be deducted from any definition of disposable income. However, any measure of income defined in this way would understate the relative standard of living of those individuals who were actually benefiting from a better quality of housing by paying more for better accommodation. Income growth over time would also understate improvements in living standards where higher costs reflected improvements in the quality of housing.</p>
<p>Conversely, any income measure which does not deduct housing costs may overstate the living standards of individuals whose housing costs are high relative to the quality of their accommodation. Growth over time in income before housing costs could also overstate improvements in living standards for low income groups in receipt of housing benefit, and whose rents have risen in real terms. This is because housing benefit may also rise to offset the higher rents (for a given quality of accommodation) and would be counted as an income rise, although there would be no associated increase in the standard of living.</p>
<p>Therefore, this publication presents analyses on two bases: before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC). This is principally to take into account variations in housing costs that themselves do not correspond to comparable variations in the quality of housing.</p>
</div>
<div id="persistent-poverty-figures" class="section level3">
<h3>Persistent Poverty figures</h3>
<p>New figures on persistent poverty were published on 26 March 2020 and can be found at <a href="http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781839606236" class="uri">http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781839606236</a>.</p>
<p>Persistent poverty identifies the number of individuals living in relative poverty for 3 or more of the last 4 years. It therefore identifies people who have been living in poverty for a significant period of time, the rationale being that this is more damaging than brief periods spent with a low income, with the impacts affecting an individual through their lifetime.</p>
<p>One of the four statutory child poverty target measures is persistent child poverty after housing costs.</p>
<p>These figures come from the Understanding Society survey which tracks individuals over time. The persistent poverty figures are not directly comparable to the figures in this publication as they use different income definitions and cover different time periods, but they provide useful additional information on poverty in Scotland.</p>

<h1>Definitions</h1>
<div id="measures-of-income" class="section level3">
<h3>Measures of income</h3>
<p>The income measure used in HBAI is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income. This comprises total income from all sources of all household members including dependants. An adjustment is made to sample cases at the top of the income distribution to correct for volatility in the highest incomes captured in the survey.</p>
<p>Income is adjusted for household size and composition by means of equivalence scales, which reflect the extent to which households of different size and composition require a different level of income to achieve the same standard of living. This adjusted income is referred to as equivalised income (see definition below for more information on equivalisation).</p>
<ul>
<li>Income before housing costs (BHC) includes the following main components: net earnings; profit or loss from self-employment after income tax and NI; all UK and Scottish social security payments, including housing and council tax benefits; all tax credits; occupational and private pension income; investment income; maintenance payments; top-up loans and parental contributions for students, educational grants and payments; the cash value of certain forms of income in kind such as free school meals, free welfare milk and free school milk and free TV licences for the over 75s (where data is available). Income is net of: income tax payments; National Insurance contributions; contributions to occupational, stakeholder and personal pension schemes; council tax; maintenance and child support payments made; and parental contributions to students living away from home.</li>
<li>Income after housing costs (AHC) is derived by deducting a measure of housing costs from the above income measure.</li>
<li>Housing costs include the following: rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates; mortgage interest payments; structural insurance premiums; ground rent and service charges.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="income-sources-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Income sources</h3>
<p>The analysis on income sources is the only analysis in this report not using net income. This analysis is based on income before taxes from employment or self-employment, social security payments, investment, occupational pensions and other income. In some cases, income from self-employment was negative in a year, for example, when someone in self-employment made a loss. In these cases, total income from earnings was reset to zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="real-prices" class="section level3">
<h3>Real prices</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, all figures relating to income are in 2018/19 prices. Values from previous years are uprated to account for inflation using a variant of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This follows a change in methodology for 2014/15. Prior to this the Retail Price Index (RPI) was used.</p>
<p>This change followed an announcement by the National Statistician that, in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the RPI and its derivatives had been assessed against the Code of Practice for Official Statistics and found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics.</p>
<p>Following a subsequent review the National Statistician, John Pullinger, wrote to the Chair of the UKSA, Sir Andrew Dilnot, setting out his view that RPI “is not a good measure of inflation” and that future usage is strongly discouraged in favour of alternative measures.</p>
<p>This led to a change in HBAI methodology in 2014/15 and the Scottish Government adopted the change in deflator to allow consistent poverty estimates for Scotland and the UK.</p>
<p>Full details can be found at this link: Methodological changes to poverty statistics</p>
</div>
<div id="equivalisation" class="section level3">
<h3>Equivalisation</h3>
<p>Equivalisation is the process by which household income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the households in which individuals live. This reflects the common sense notion that, in order to enjoy a comparable standard of living, a household of, for example, three adults will need a higher income than a single person living alone. The process of adjusting income in this way is known as equivalisation and is needed in order to make sensible income comparisons between households.</p>
<p>Equivalence scales conventionally take an adult couple without children as the reference point, with an equivalence value of one. The process then increases relatively the income of single person households (since their incomes are divided by a value of less than one) and reduces relatively the incomes of households with three or more persons, which have an equivalence value of greater than one.</p>
<p>Consider a single person, a couple with no children, and a couple with two children aged fourteen and ten, all having unadjusted weekly household incomes of £200 (Before Housing Costs). The process of equivalisation, as conducted in HBAI, gives an equivalised income of £299 to the single person, £200 to the couple with no children, but only £131 to the couple with children.</p>
<p>The equivalence scales used here are the modified OECD scales. Two separate scales are used, one for income Before Housing Costs (BHC) and one for income After Housing Costs (AHC). Modified OECD rescaled to a couple without children is as follows:</p>
<p>BHC AHC First Adult 0.67 0.58 Spouse 0.33 0.42 Subsequent Adults 0.33 0.42 Children aged under 14 years 0.20 0.20 Children aged 14 years and over 0.33 0.42</p>
<p>The construction of household equivalence values from these scales is quite straightforward. For example, the BHC equivalence value for a household containing a couple with a fourteen year old and a ten year old child together with one other adult would be 1.86 from the sum of the scale values:</p>
<p>0.67 + 0.33 + 0.33 + 0.33 + 0.20 = 1.86</p>
<p>This is made up of 0.67 for the first adult, 0.33 for their spouse, the other adult and the fourteen year old child and 0.20 for the ten year old child. The total income for the household would then be divided by 1.86 in order to arrive at the measure of equivalised household income used in HBAI analysis.</p>
<p>Further information on equivalisation can be found in the methodology report on the Scottish Government website.</p>

<div id="dependent-children" class="section level3">
<h3>Dependent children</h3>
<p>In this publication, ‘child’ refers to a dependent child. A dependent child is a person either aged 0-15, or aged 16-19 and: not married nor in a Civil Partnership nor living with a partner, and living with their parents, and in full-time non-advanced education or in unwaged government training.</p>
</div>
<div id="single-women-with-children" class="section level3">
<h3>Single women with children</h3>
<p>Family types are becoming increasingly complex. In this publication, single women with children refers to a situation where the primary residence of a dependent child is in a household with one adult, who is female. Data for single men with dependent children is not available due to small sample sizes. This household type does not necessarily imply that the child only has contact with one parent. The child may have non-resident parents who contribute to their welfare. Currently, some, but not all income transfers from a non-resident parent to the resident parent (such as Child Maintenance payments) are included in the household income.</p>
</div>
<div id="poverty-measurement-from-the-family-resources-survey" class="section level3">
<h3>Poverty measurement from the Family Resources Survey</h3>
<p>Individuals are defined as being in poverty if their equivalised net disposable household income is below 60 percent of the UK median. The median is the income value which divides a population, when ranked by income, into two equal sized groups. Since the mean is influenced considerably by the highest incomes, median income thresholds are widely accepted as a better benchmark when considering a derived measure for poverty. Sixty percent of the median is the most commonly used poverty measure.</p>
<p>For a couple with no children, the UK median income BHC in 2016-19 was £517 per week, which had increased by £6 in real terms since 2015-18. After housing costs, the UK median increased by £5 to £464 per week compared to 2015-18.</p>
<p>Consequently, the 60 percent poverty threshold, which is used to derive the low income household figures, has also increased in real terms, before and after housing costs. This means a household has to have a larger income in real terms to be above the poverty threshold.</p>
</div>
<div id="relative-and-absolute-poverty" class="section level3">
<h3>Relative and absolute poverty</h3>
<ul>
<li>Absolute poverty - individuals living in households whose equivalised income is below 60 percent of inflation adjusted median income in 2010/11. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are seeing their incomes rise in real terms.</li>
<li>Relative poverty - individuals living in households whose equivalised income is below 60 percent of median income in the same year. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="material-deprivation-for-children" class="section level3">
<h3>Material deprivation for children</h3>
<p>A suite of questions designed to capture the material deprivation experienced by households with children has been included in the Family Resources Survey since 2004/05. Respondents are asked whether they have 21 goods and services, including child, adult and household items. The list of items was identified by independent academic analysis. See McKay, S. and Collard, S. (2004). Together, these questions form the best discriminator between those households that are deprived and those that are not. If they do not have a good or service, they are asked whether this is because they do not want them or because they cannot afford them.</p>
<p>These questions are used as an additional way of measuring living standards for children and their households.</p>
<p>A prevalence weighted approach has been used, in combination with a relative low income threshold. The income threshold is 70 percent of the median income. Prevalence weighting is a technique of scoring deprivation in which more weight in the deprivation measure is given to households lacking those items that most in the population already have. This means a greater importance, when an item is lacked, is assigned to those items that are more commonly owned in the population.</p>
</div>
<div id="changes-to-measuring-material-deprivation-in-201011" class="section level3">
<h3>Changes to measuring material deprivation in 2010/11</h3>
<p>The 21 items in the suite of questions used to measure material deprivation are designed to reflect the items and activities people in the UK believe to be necessary. These items are reviewed periodically to ensure the measure remains a relative measure of poverty. In 2010/11 four new questions about additional items were included in the FRS to be used in the future calculation of material deprivation scores, replacing the four existing items that were identified by research as potentially out of date partly because the proportion of the population considering them necessary had fallen. As such, there is a break in the series for child low income/material deprivation and estimates from 2010/11 onwards cannot be compared to those from before 2010/11.</p>
<p>In the 2010/11 FRS, both the new and the old questions were asked. As such, estimates are presented based on both sets of questions for this year.</p>
<p>For further information about material deprivation see the DWP Households Below Average Income publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="material-deprivation-for-pensioners" class="section level3">
<h3>Material deprivation for pensioners</h3>
<p>A suite of questions designed to capture the material deprivation experienced by pensioner households has been included in the Family Resources Survey since 2009/10. Respondents are asked whether they have access to 15 goods and services. The list of items was identified by independent academic analysis. See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legard, R., Gray, M. and Blake, M. (2008), Cognitive testing: older people and the FRS material deprivation questions, Department for Work and Pensions Working Paper Number 55. Available on the Bristol University webpages.</li>
<li>McKay, S. (2008), Measuring material deprivation among older people: Methodological study to revise the Family Resources Survey questions, Department for Work and Pensions Working Paper Number 54. Available on the Bristol University webpages. Together, these questions form the best discriminator between those pensioner households that are deprived and those that are not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where they do not have a good or service, pensioner households are asked whether this is because they do not have the money for this, it is not a priority on their current income, their health / disability prevents them, it is too much trouble or tiring, they have no one to do this with or help them, it is not something they want, it is not relevant to them, or any other reason. Where a pensioner lacks one of the material deprivation items for one of the following reasons - they do not have the money for this, it is not a priority for them on their current income, their health / disability prevents them, it is too much trouble or tiring, they have no one to do this with or help them, or any other reason - they are counted as being deprived for that item.</p>
<p>The exception to this is for the question on whether they could cover an unexpected expense, where the follow up question was asked to explore how those who responded ‘yes’ would cover this cost. Options were: use own income but cut back on essentials, use own income but not need to cut back on essentials, use savings; use a form of credit, get money from friends or family, or any other reason. Pensioners are counted as materially deprived for this item if and only if they responded ‘no’ to the initial question.</p>
<p>The same prevalence weighted approach has been used to that for children, in determining a deprivation score. Prevalence weighting is a technique of scoring deprivation in which more weight in the deprivation measure is given to households lacking those items that most already have. This means a greater importance, when an item is lacked, is assigned to those items that are more commonly owned in the pensioner population.</p>
<p>For children, material deprivation is presented as an indicator in combination with a low income threshold. However for pensioners, the concept of material deprivation is broad and very different from low income; therefore, it is appropriate to present it as a separate measure.</p>
<p>A technical note given a full explanation of the pensioner material deprivation measure is available for download.</p>

<div id="population-coverage" class="section level3">
<h3>Population coverage</h3>
<p>The FRS is a survey of private households. This means that people in residential institutions, such as nursing homes, barracks, prisons or university halls of residence, and also homeless people are excluded from the scope of the analysis presented here. The area of Scotland north of the Caledonian Canal was included in the FRS for the first time in the 2001/02 survey year, and from the 2002/03 survey year, the FRS was extended to include a 100 percent boost of the Scottish sample. This has increased the sample size available for analysis at the Scottish level. In 2002/03, the sample size was around five thousand. However, following cost savings introduced to the FRS in 2010, the sample size in Scotland has reduced. It was just over 2,800 households in 2018/19. For further information see the DWP Households Below Average Income publication.</p>

<div id="reliability-of-estimates" class="section level3">
<h3>Reliability of estimates</h3>
<p>The figures are estimates based on sample surveys and are therefore subject to sampling variation. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of small year-on-year fluctuations. Identification of trends should be based on data for several years. Estimates for the confidence intervals around the key figures presented here will be available on the Scottish Government Poverty statistics webpages shortly after publication.</p>
<p>The method used to calculate these confidence intervals changed in 2015/16. Information on this can be in DWP’s statistical notice. The new method widens confidence intervals for most estimates making statistically significant results less likely than before.</p>
<p>The Family Resources Survey publication contains information on topics such as sample design, non-response biases, weighting; item non-response, imputation and editing; accuracy of income data.</p>
